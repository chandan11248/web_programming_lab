# Lab 2: Web Programming with JavaScript

This repository contains my solutions for Lab 2 of the Web Programming course. In this lab, I focused on building 10 different interactive applications using pure Vanilla JavaScript, without relying on any external frameworks or libraries.

## What I Learned
Through this lab, I gained hands-on experience with core JavaScript concepts and how they interact with the DOM. Specifically, I learned:

-   **DOM Manipulation**: How to dynamically create, modify, and delete HTML elements to update the user interface in real-time.
-   **Event Handling**: Managing user interactions like clicks, form submissions, and keyboard inputs to make applications responsive.
-   **Data Structures**: Using arrays and objects to store and manage application state (like the todo list tasks or student records).
-   **Logic & Control Flow**: Implementing game logic (Number Guessing), mathematical operations (Calculator), and conditional feedback (Form Validation).
-   **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Using `setInterval` and `clearInterval` to build a functioning digital clock and countdown timer.
-   **Styling with JS**: Dynamically changing CSS properties to implement a Theme Manager.

## Lab Report & Questions
You can find the detailed problem statements and requirements in the [Lab Questions PDF](lab2_web_programming.pdf).

My full detailed report, including flowcharts, source code explanations, and outputs, is available in the `lab_report.tex` file (which can be compiled to PDF).

## Project Structure
The lab is divided into 10 problems, each in its own directory:
1.  **Smart Calculator**: `problem1/`
2.  **Grade Analyzer**: `problem2/`
3.  **To-Do List**: `problem3/`
4.  **Number Guessing Game**: `problem4/`
5.  **Quiz Application**: `problem5/`
6.  **Digital Clock**: `problem6/`
7.  **Dynamic Table**: `problem7/`
8.  **Shopping Cart**: `problem8/`
9.  **Form Validation**: `problem9/`
10. **Theme Manager**: `problem10/`

Each directory contains the `index.html` and `script.js` for that specific problem.
